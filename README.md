Hello!
My name is Maria CLara Brito. I data science student.

Here some of my projects:

1. My Architecture and NoSQL teacher asked for a airflow DAG fetching a csv file feeding a Database learned during classes, running on Docker. The database choosen, MongoDB. Beyond that, we must show the csv content on PowerBI or ELK.
    Take a look at my archives by the folowing link: 


2.During our journey at the first grade at University we received a challenge from a partner company of FIAP called Mindsight. Our challenge was present a soluction to help the energy concessionaires like Enel predict energy interrupment caused by the weather in São Paulo.
So we developed a simple machine learning to analise the weather data, extracted by an API running since a DAG(airflow) running on a container(Docker) and the data from energy interrupment both open data.
Take a look at the final version of our soluction:
