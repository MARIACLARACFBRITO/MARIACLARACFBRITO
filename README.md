# My Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! Here you will find information about my skills, projects, and how to contact me.

## About Me

I am a Data Science student with a strong interest in the financial market, particularly in analyzing asset projections and the market as a whole. Additionally, I am fascinated by the potential of AI and Data Science to revolutionize healthcare. One of my aspirations is to work in a setting that focuses on predictive analytics, such as technologies that can forecast breast cancer five years in advance, which is already being developed.

## Projects

### 1. [Airflow DAG with MongoDB and Data Visualization](https://github.com/MARIACLARACFBRITO/airflow_docker)
- **Description:** For my Architecture and NoSQL class, I created an Airflow DAG that fetches a CSV file and loads it into MongoDB, which is running inside a Docker container. The data was then visualized using Power BI or ELK.
- **Skills Demonstrated:** Airflow, MongoDB, Docker, Data Visualization.

### 2. [Predicting Power Outages Using Weather Data](link-to-project)
- **Description:** During my first year at FIAP, we collaborated with Mindsight to help energy providers like Enel predict power outages caused by weather conditions in São Paulo. We developed a machine learning model to analyze weather data extracted from an API via a DAG (Airflow) running in a Docker container, combined with open data on energy outages.
- **Skills Demonstrated:** Machine Learning, Airflow, Docker, Data Analysis.

### 3. [Predicting Churn Using ML](https://github.com/MARIACLARACFBRITO/)
- **Description:** In the course "Classificação: aprendendo a classificar dados com Machine Learning," the goal was to develop a model to predict customer churn for a fictitious company. This project focused on creating a classification model to identify customers at higher risk of canceling their services, providing actionable insights for targeted retention strategies.
- **Skills Demonstrated:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Machine Learning.
