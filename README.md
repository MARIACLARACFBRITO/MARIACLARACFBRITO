Hello! 👋
My name is Maria Clara Brito, and I'm a Data Science student.

Here are some of my projects:

1. Airflow DAG with MongoDB and Data Visualization
For my Architecture and NoSQL class, we were tasked with creating an Airflow DAG that fetches a CSV file and loads it into a database. I chose MongoDB for the database, running inside a Docker container. Additionally, the CSV data was visualized using Power BI or ELK.

📁 You can check out the files and full solution .

2. Predicting Power Outages Using Weather Data
During my first year at FIAP, we were presented with a challenge by a partner company, Mindsight, to help energy providers like Enel predict power outages caused by weather conditions in São Paulo. Our solution was to develop a simple machine learning model to analyze weather data extracted from an API via a DAG (Airflow) running in a Docker container, combined with open data on energy outages.

📁 Take a look at the final version of our solution .
