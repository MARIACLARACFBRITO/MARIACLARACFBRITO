# My Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! Here you will find information about my skills, projects, and how to contact me.

## About Me

I am a Data Science student with a strong interest in the financial market, particularly in analyzing asset projections and the market as a whole. Additionally, I am fascinated by the potential of AI and Data Science to revolutionize healthcare. One of my aspirations is to work in a setting that focuses on predictive analytics, such as technologies that can forecast breast cancer five years in advance, which is already being developed.

## Projects

### 1. [Airflow DAG with MongoDB and Data Visualization](https://github.com/MARIACLARACFBRITO/airflow_docker)
- **Description:** For my Architecture and NoSQL class, I created an Airflow DAG that fetches a CSV file and loads it into MongoDB, which is running inside a Docker container. The data was then visualized using Power BI or ELK.
- **Skills Demonstrated:** Airflow, MongoDB, Docker, Data Visualization.

### 2. [Predicting Power Outages Using Weather Data](https://github.com/MARIACLARACFBRITO/power_outages_prediction)
- **Description:** During my first year at FIAP, we collaborated with Mindsight to help energy providers like Enel predict power outages caused by weather conditions in São Paulo. We developed a machine learning model to analyze weather data extracted from an API via a DAG (Airflow) running in a Docker container, combined with open data on energy outages.
- **Skills Demonstrated:** Machine Learning, Airflow, Docker, Data Analysis.

### 3. [Predicting Churn Using ML](https://github.com/MARIACLARACFBRITO/)
- **Description:** In the course "Classificação: aprendendo a classificar dados com Machine Learning," the goal was to develop a model to predict customer churn for a fictitious company. This project focused on creating a classification model to identify customers at higher risk of canceling their services, providing actionable insights for targeted retention strategies.
- **Skills Demonstrated:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Machine Learning.

#### 4.[Predicting college dropout using ML](https://github.com/MARIACLARACFBRITO/withdrawal-from-college)
Description: This project aimed to predict college dropout rates using machine learning techniques. The goal was to create a model that identifies students at risk of leaving the university, enabling targeted retention strategies. The process included analyzing the relationship between attributes and the target variable, addressing data imbalance with SMOTE, and training models like Random Forest and Gradient Boosting. Metrics such as recall, precision, F1 score, and confusion matrix were used to evaluate performance.
- **Skills Demonstrated:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SMOTE, Confusion Matrix, Pipeline, Stratified K-Fold Validation, Machine Learning.
